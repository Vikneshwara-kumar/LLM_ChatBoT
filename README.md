- **View Historic Conversations**: Sidebar feature to view past conversations stored in the database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- SQLite3
- Groq API key (for LLM integration)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikneshwara-kumar/LLM_ChatBoT.git
   cd the-one-who-knows-everything
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variable or Streamlit secrets for the Groq API key:

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

   Or create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with the following content:

   ```toml
   mkdir .streamlit
   echo "GROQ_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'" > .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser (the default URL is usually `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Enter your message in the text input field and click "Send" to get a response from the assistant.
3. Use the sidebar to configure the system prompt, adjust the response temperature, and view or clear chat history.

## Code Structure

- **app.py**: Main application file containing the Streamlit app code.
- **initialize_groq**: Sets up the Groq API client using the provided API key.
- **init_db**: Initializes the SQLite database and creates a table for storing chat history if it does not exist.
- **store_conversation**: Stores the conversation (user message and bot response) in the database.
- **get_chat_history**: Retrieves the chat history from the database.
- **format_messages**: Formats messages for the LLM API, including the system prompt and chat history.
